# Unidades_Metrobus

This job consists of get requests that return lists or values from a PostgreSql or SQLite database. The database SQLITE is metrobus.db
This data has been entered from a dataset.csv file to the "unidades" table. In the code there is no INSERT query so everything is done with SELECT filters.
The intention is to upload this REST API to a DOCKER container and to be able to make the requests from there with the previously entered data.
